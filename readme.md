## Setup Instructions

Choose either **Local Development** or **Deployment**.

### 1. Local Development

Follow these steps to run Speakr on your local machine for development or testing.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/speakr.git](https://github.com/your-username/speakr.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd speakr
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Copy the example environment file (if you create one) or create a new file named `.env` in the project root.
    * Add the following variables, replacing placeholder values with your actual keys and endpoints:

        ```dotenv
        # --- Required for Summaries/Chat ---
        # (Use OpenRouter or another OpenAI-compatible Chat API)
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..." # Your OpenRouter or compatible API key
        OPENROUTER_BASE_URL="[https://openrouter.ai/api/v1](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1)" # Or your chat model endpoint
        # Recommended Models: openai/gpt-4o-mini, google/gemini-flash-1.5, etc.
        OPENROUTER_MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-4o-mini"

        # --- Required for Transcription ---
        # (Use OpenAI Whisper API or a compatible local/remote endpoint)
        OPENAI_API_KEY="cant-be-empty" # Use your OpenAI key OR often "none", "NA", "cant-be-empty" for local endpoints
        OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://YOUR_LOCAL_WHISPER_IP:PORT/v1/" # Your transcription endpoint URL
        # Set the specific model name your transcription endpoint uses (if needed by API)
        TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL_NAME="Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3" # Or the model your endpoint expects

        # --- Flask Specific ---
        # A strong, random secret key is crucial for session security.
        # Generate one using: python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
        SECRET_KEY="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY"

        # --- Optional ---
        # Set to 'false' to disable new user registrations
        ALLOW_REGISTRATION="true"
        ```

5.  **Database Setup & Migrations:**
    * The application uses SQLite by default, stored in `instance/transcriptions.db`.
    * Run the necessary migrations to set up or update the database schema:
        ```bash
        python migrate_db.py
        python migrate_original_filename.py
        python migrate_is_admin.py
        ```
    * *(Note: If you ever need to start completely fresh, you can use `python reset_db.py`, but **be careful as this deletes all data**)*

6.  **Create an Admin User:**
    * Run the interactive script to create your first user with admin privileges:
        ```bash
        python create_admin.py
        ```
    * Follow the prompts to enter a username, email, and password.

7.  **Run the Application:**
    * **Option A (Flask Development Server - recommended for local dev):**
        ```bash
        flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8899
        # Or (if flask command not found, ensure venv is active):
        # python app.py
        ```
    * **Option B (Gunicorn - closer to production):**
        ```bash
        gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8899 --timeout 600 app:app
        ```

8.  **Access Speakr:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8899` (or your server's IP address if running remotely).

### 2. Deployment (Linux with Systemd)

The `deployment/setup.sh` script automates the setup process on a Linux server using `systemd`.

**Warning:** Review the script carefully before running it, especially the paths and user (`$USER`) it assumes.

1.  **Copy Project:** Ensure all project files (including the `deployment` directory and your configured `.env` file) are on the target server.
2.  **Make Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x deployment/setup.sh
    ```
3.  **Run Setup Script:**
    ```bash
    sudo bash deployment/setup.sh
    ```
    * This script will:
        * Create `/opt/transcription-app`.
        * Copy necessary files.
        * Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
        * Ensure `.env` exists and has a `SECRET_KEY`.
        * Create `uploads` and `instance` directories.
        * Initialize or migrate the database (`reset_db.py` on first run, `migrate_db.py` otherwise).
        * Set file ownership.
        * Create and enable a `systemd` service (`transcription.service`) to run the app with Gunicorn.
        * Start the service.
        * Prompt you to create an admin user.

4.  **Service Management:**
    * **Check Status:** `sudo systemctl status transcription.service`
    * **Stop Service:** `sudo systemctl stop transcription.service`
    * **Start Service:** `sudo systemctl start transcription.service`
    * **Restart Service:** `sudo systemctl restart transcription.service`
    * **View Logs:** `sudo journalctl -u transcription.service -f` (follow logs)
    * **View Recent Logs:** `sudo journalctl -u transcription.service -n 100 --no-pager`

5.  **Access Speakr:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8899`.

## Configuration

Configuration is primarily handled through the `.env` file in the project root (or `/opt/transcription-app` if deployed using the script).

**Key Variables:**

* `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: **Required.** Your API key for the chat/summarization model endpoint (e.g., OpenRouter API Key).
* `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`: *Optional.* The base URL for the chat/summarization API. Defaults to OpenRouter's URL.
* `OPENROUTER_MODEL_NAME`: *Optional.* The specific model to use for chat/summarization (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `google/gemini-flash-1.5`). Defaults to `openai/gpt-4o-mini` if not set (update from code default).
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: **Required.** Your API key for the transcription endpoint. For local endpoints, this might be a specific string like "none" or "NA". Check your endpoint's documentation.
* `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: **Required.** The base URL for your transcription API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8787/v1/`).
* `TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL_NAME`: *Optional.* The specific model name your transcription endpoint uses/expects (e.g., `Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3`). Check your endpoint's requirements.
* `SECRET_KEY`: **Required.** A long, random string used by Flask for session security. The `setup.sh` script generates one if it's missing.
* `ALLOW_REGISTRATION`: *Optional.* Set to `false` to prevent new users from registering via the web UI. Defaults to `true`.

## Usage

1.  **Register/Login:** Access the web application via your browser. Register a new account (if enabled) or log in.
2.  **Upload:** Go to "New Recording" or drag-and-drop audio files onto the page. Upload progress and subsequent processing status will appear in the bottom-left popup.
3.  **View Recordings:** The main "Gallery" view lists your recordings, grouped by date. Click on a recording to view its details.
4.  **Interact:**
    * Listen to the audio using the player.
    * Read the transcription.
    * Review the AI-generated summary and title.
    * Read or edit metadata (participants, notes, meeting date). Use the small edit icons or the "Edit Details" button.
    * Use the "Chat with Transcript" panel to ask questions about the recording content.
5.  **Manage:** Edit details or delete recordings using the buttons in the detail view or the icons in the recording list.

## Admin Panel

* Accessible at `/admin` for logged-in admin users.
* **User Management:** View, add, edit (username, email, password, admin status), and delete users.
* **System Statistics:** View application-wide usage data.

## Database Management

The following scripts are located in the application root (`/opt/transcription-app` if deployed):

* `migrate_db.py`, `migrate_original_filename.py`, `migrate_is_admin.py`: Run these (in order if setting up an older version) to apply schema updates *without* losing existing data. The `setup.sh` script runs `migrate_db.py` automatically if the database already exists.
* `reset_db.py`: **Use with caution!** This script deletes the existing database (`instance/transcriptions.db`) and the contents of the `uploads` directory, then creates a fresh, empty database schema.
